# Authentication

GitDesk needs access to your GitHub account to fetch your pull requests. Choose your preferred authentication method below.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="GitHub OAuth" icon="github">
    **Recommended** — One-click sign in with automatic token management. No manual setup required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Personal Access Token" icon="setting">
    Manual setup for users who prefer explicit token control or have SSO requirements.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Sign in with GitHub (Recommended)

The easiest way to connect is using GitHub's secure OAuth device flow. Your browser handles authentication while GitDesk waits for confirmation.

<div class="auth-flow">
  <span class="auth-flow-step">📱 GitDesk</span>
  <span class="auth-flow-arrow">→</span>
  <span class="auth-flow-step">🌐 Browser</span>
  <span class="auth-flow-arrow">→</span>
  <span class="auth-flow-step">🔐 GitHub</span>
  <span class="auth-flow-arrow">→</span>
  <span class="auth-flow-step">✓ Authorized</span>
</div>

<Steps>
1. Launch GitDesk and click **"Sign in with GitHub"**

2. Your browser opens to GitHub's device activation page

3. Enter the 8-character code shown in GitDesk (e.g., `ABCD-1234`)

4. Click **"Authorize openza"** to grant access

5. Return to GitDesk — you're automatically signed in!
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  OAuth tokens are automatically managed and stored securely. No need to create or manage tokens manually.
</Aside>

## Personal Access Token (Alternative)

If you prefer, you can use a Personal Access Token instead.

<Steps>
1. Click **"Use personal access token"** on the sign-in screen

2. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

3. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**

4. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "GitDesk Desktop")

5. Select the required scopes:
   - `repo` - Full control of private repositories
   - `read:user` - Read your profile information

6. Click **"Generate token"** and copy it

7. Paste the token in GitDesk and click **"Connect"**
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  Keep your token secure! Never share it or commit it to version control.
</Aside>

## Secure Token Storage

Your credentials are stored securely using your system's native secret storage — never in plain text files.

<div class="feature-highlight">
  <strong>🔒 Platform Integration</strong><br/>
  GitDesk uses the Secret Service API to integrate with your desktop environment's secure credential storage.
</div>

| Desktop Environment | Secret Storage Backend |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **GNOME** | GNOME Keyring (`gnome-keyring-daemon`) |
| **KDE Plasma** | KWallet (`kwalletd5`) |
| **Other** | Secret Service API compatible daemon |

## Organization Filter

After signing in, you can filter PRs by organization:

1. Click the organization dropdown in the header
2. Select a specific organization or "All Organizations"
3. PR lists will update to show only PRs from that organization

<Aside type="note">
  The organization filter is remembered across sessions.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth Flow Not Opening Browser

- Ensure you have a default browser configured
- Try clicking "Open GitHub" manually if the browser doesn't open automatically

### "Bad Credentials" Error (PAT)

- Ensure you copied the entire token
- Check that the token hasn't expired
- Verify the token has the required scopes

### Token Not Saving

- Ensure your system's secret storage service is running
- On GNOME, check that `gnome-keyring` is installed
- On KDE, check that `kwallet` is running

## Sign Out

To sign out or switch accounts:

1. Click the settings/menu icon
2. Select **"Sign Out"**
3. You'll return to the authentication screen
