# Authentication

GitDesk needs access to your GitHub account to fetch your pull requests. You can authenticate using GitHub OAuth (recommended) or a Personal Access Token.

## Sign in with GitHub (Recommended)

The easiest way to connect is using GitHub's secure OAuth device flow.

<Steps>
1. Launch GitDesk and click **"Sign in with GitHub"**

2. A browser window opens to GitHub's device activation page

3. Enter the code shown in GitDesk

4. Click **"Authorize"** to grant GitDesk access

5. Return to GitDesk - you're now signed in!
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  OAuth tokens are automatically managed and stored securely. No need to create or manage tokens manually.
</Aside>

## Personal Access Token (Alternative)

If you prefer, you can use a Personal Access Token instead.

<Steps>
1. Click **"Use personal access token"** on the sign-in screen

2. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

3. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**

4. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "GitDesk Desktop")

5. Select the required scopes:
   - `repo` - Full control of private repositories
   - `read:user` - Read your profile information

6. Click **"Generate token"** and copy it

7. Paste the token in GitDesk and click **"Connect"**
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  Keep your token secure! Never share it or commit it to version control.
</Aside>

## Token Storage

Your credentials are stored securely using your system's secret storage:

| System | Storage |
|--------|---------|
| GNOME | GNOME Keyring |
| KDE | KWallet |
| Other | Secret Service API |

## Organization Filter

After signing in, you can filter PRs by organization:

1. Click the organization dropdown in the header
2. Select a specific organization or "All Organizations"
3. PR lists will update to show only PRs from that organization

<Aside type="note">
  The organization filter is remembered across sessions.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth Flow Not Opening Browser

- Ensure you have a default browser configured
- Try clicking "Open GitHub" manually if the browser doesn't open automatically

### "Bad Credentials" Error (PAT)

- Ensure you copied the entire token
- Check that the token hasn't expired
- Verify the token has the required scopes

### Token Not Saving

- Ensure your system's secret storage service is running
- On GNOME, check that `gnome-keyring` is installed
- On KDE, check that `kwallet` is running

## Sign Out

To sign out or switch accounts:

1. Click the settings/menu icon
2. Select **"Sign Out"**
3. You'll return to the authentication screen
