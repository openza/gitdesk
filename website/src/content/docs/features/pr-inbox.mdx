# PR Inbox

The PR Inbox is the main interface of GitDesk, showing all your pull request activity in one place.

## Inbox Tabs

GitDesk organizes your PRs into two main tabs:

### Review Requests Tab

This tab shows PRs that need your attention:

**Pending Reviews**
- PRs where you've been requested as a reviewer
- Shows PR title, repository, and author
- Displays time since last update

**Recently Reviewed**
- PRs you've recently reviewed
- Shows your review status (Approved, Changes Requested, Commented, Pending)
- Helps you track PRs you're involved with

### Created Tab

This tab shows PRs you've authored:

**Open Pull Requests**
- Your currently open PRs
- Track review status from your team
- See merge readiness at a glance

**Recently Created**

- Quick access to PRs you've authored

## PR Card Information

Each PR card displays:

| Field | Description |

## Organization Filter

Filter PRs by organization using the dropdown in the header:
