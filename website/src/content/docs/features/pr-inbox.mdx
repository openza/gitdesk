# PR Inbox

The PR Inbox is your command center — all pull request activity organized in one clean interface. No more hunting through GitHub notifications.

<div class="feature-highlight">
  <strong>⚡ Real-time Updates</strong> — Background refresh every 5 minutes keeps your inbox current without manual intervention.
</div>

## Inbox Tabs

GitDesk organizes your PRs into two focused views:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Review Requests" icon="approve-check-circle">
    PRs waiting for your review, plus PRs you've recently reviewed. Your review queue at a glance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Created" icon="pencil">
    PRs you've authored. Track review status and merge readiness for your own work.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Review Requests Tab

This tab shows PRs that need your attention:

<Aside type="note" title="Pending Reviews">
PRs where you've been requested as a reviewer. Each card shows the PR title, repository, author, and time since last update.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Recently Reviewed">
PRs you've already reviewed. Shows your review status — Approved ✓, Changes Requested ✗, Commented 💬, or Pending ⏳.
</Aside>

### Created Tab

Your authored PRs organized by status:

<Aside type="note" title="Open Pull Requests">
Your currently open PRs with review status from your team. See merge readiness at a glance.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Recently Created">
Quick access to your most recently created PRs, regardless of current status.
</Aside>

## Organization Filter

<div class="feature-highlight">
  <strong>🏢 Multi-org Support</strong> — Working across multiple organizations? Filter your inbox to focus on one org at a time.
</div>

Use the dropdown in the header to filter:

- **All Organizations** — Show PRs from all your GitHub organizations
